# Sales Performance Analysis | Data Analytics & BI

This project showcases a complete **data analyst workflow**—from raw data preparation to insight generation and interactive dashboarding. Using five years of U.S. sales data, the analysis identifies trends, profitability drivers, and opportunities to improve revenue and margins.

The project emphasizes **business questions, exploratory analysis, and data-driven recommendations**, supported by Python-based EDA and Power BI reporting.

## 📊 Business Problem
Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven view of regional and channel performance. This results in:
- Inconsistent revenue and profit across regions
- Limited visibility into seasonal demand patterns
- Poor understanding of top products, customers, and margin drivers

**Goal:** Leverage historical sales data to identify growth levers, improve profitability, and enable self-service analytics for business users.

---

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze historical sales, profit, and margin trends
- Identify seasonal patterns and revenue outliers
- Evaluate performance by region, state, channel, product, and customer
- Build an interactive dashboard for ad-hoc business insights
- Provide actionable recommendations based on data findings

---

## 📁 Dataset
The analysis integrates multiple business datasets:
- Sales transactions
- Customers
- Products
- Sales channels
- Budgets
- U.S. states and regions

### Final Dataset Includes:
- **Financial metrics:** revenue, cost, profit, profit margin %
- **Time dimensions:** order date, month, year
- **Geography:** state, region
- **Business dimensions:** customer, product, channel

Data quality checks confirmed **no missing values or duplicates** after cleaning.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted using Python to answer key business questions:
- Monthly and yearly sales trends
- Seasonality and revenue outliers
- Channel performance comparison
- State and regional sales distribution
- Average Order Value (AOV) analysis
- Customer segmentation by revenue and margin
- Correlation analysis to identify revenue drivers

### 3. Data Visualization & Reporting

## 🗝️ Key Insights
- **Seasonality:** Consistent revenue peaks in May–June; lowest sales in January
- **Channel Performance:** Wholesale drives volume (54%), Export yields highest margins (~38%)
- **Geographic Trends:** California contributes nearly 20% of total revenue
- **Customer Segmentation:** Mid-revenue customers ($6–9M) achieve the strongest margins (>40%)
- **Revenue Drivers:** Unit price has a stronger impact on profit than order quantity
- **Order Behavior:** High frequency of small orders with a valuable long tail of large transactions

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Leverage predictable seasonal peaks with targeted marketing and inventory planning
- Incentivize higher-margin Export sales while protecting Wholesale volume
- Upsell high-margin mid-tier customers
- Reduce geographic dependency on California by expanding in high-potential states
- Increase AOV through bundling, tiered pricing, or minimum order incentives
